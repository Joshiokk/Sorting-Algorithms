# Sorting-Algorithms

Features:

  1. Acutal coding of sorting Algos implemented in Python
  
  2. Allows user testing of time complexity by generating random size int arrays
  
Usage:

  *__Please run the corresponding algorithm in Part 1 first__
  before testing its time complexity in Part 2.
   (eg. to test time complexity of MergeSort, Run Merge&MergeSort first)
  
  *Alternatively(**Recommended for learning purpose**):
    To run all the algos in order, Click **Cell** , Select **Run All**
